[User Documentation][docs].

## Contributing

The saltext-stalekey project team welcomes contributions from the community.

The [Salt Contributing guide][salt-contributing] has a lot of relevant
information, but if you'd like to jump right in here's how to get started:


```bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env

# Clone the repo
git clone --origin upstream git@github.com:salt-extensions/saltext-stalekey.git

# Change to the repo dir
cd saltext-stalekey

# Create a new venv
uv venv -p 3.10
source .venv/bin/activate

# On WSL or some flavors of linux you may need to install the `enchant`
# library in order to build the docs
sudo apt-get install -y enchant

# Install extension + test/dev/doc dependencies into your environment
uv pip install -e ".[dev,tests,docs]"

# Run tests!
nox -e tests-3

# skip requirements install for next time
export SKIP_REQUIREMENTS_INSTALL=1

# Build the docs, serve, and view in your web browser:
nox -e docs-dev
```

Writing code isn't the only way to contribute! We value contributions in any of
these areas:

* Documentation - especially examples of how to use this module to solve
  specific problems.
* Triaging [issues][issues] and participating in [discussions][discussions]
* Reviewing [Pull Requests][PRs] (we really like
  [Conventional Comments][comments]!)

You could also contribute in other ways:

* Writing blog posts
* Posting on social media about how you used Salt + Stalekey to solve your
  problems, including videos
* Giving talks at conferences
* Publishing videos
* Asking/answering questions in IRC, Discord or email groups

Any of these things are super valuable to our community, and we sincerely
appreciate every contribution!

that's where you'll find the rest of the documentation.
